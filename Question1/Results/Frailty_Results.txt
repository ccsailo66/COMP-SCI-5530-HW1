This would be where various results from tests I perform during the analysis step would be.
For example, I could perform a t-test to try to construct a confidence interval for the mean of grip strength.
I could also try to see if having frailty correlates to an older age, for example. In either case, the results from these tests would be in this folder.
I think visuals, like graphs, would go here too.
Depending on how many tests I conduct, I should probably have different text files for each result.
